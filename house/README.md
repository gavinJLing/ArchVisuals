# House

## 2018

A House, where I'd like to Live. I normally do not use Git/GitHub for this kind of design work. But Its 2018 and cloud cloud, cloud.

Not sure how this is going to work out.
The project conect is Lightwave 9 files. I used to use Lightwave back in 1998/2007 - but forgot about it until I stubled upon it. So I gave it a wirl after an intial period of struggling to find the things that I needed - it all came flooeding back.
