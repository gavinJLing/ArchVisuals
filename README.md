# House

A House, where I'd like to Live.

A rural 193o's family home. Which has been extended at the rear with a single upper Master bedroom
and pitched roof. 

This a gable end extension - assuming that a loft conversion has also taken place.

## Master Bedroom
Added to the rear of th property. As a cantalever structure. With a period feature cast iron stansion
to support the over hanging corner. Intercepting with a Kitchen 'island' beneath. 

## Kitchen
An integrated kitched partly underneath the master bedroom/lounge reception. Also extening into the 
Lean-to conservatory structure that wrapps around the ground floor foot print of the upper floor extsion.

## Conservatory
This structure is useed to balance up the plan evelation foot print of the property. It wraps
around the extesion and extends the ground floor extension to the entire width of teh property.
